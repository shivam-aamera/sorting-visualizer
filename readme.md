This repository contains our project code i.e, Sorting algorithm visualization which we made using HTML, CSS, JS.

We have learned sorting algorithms like the bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm, maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization. Thatâ€™s why we are making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.
